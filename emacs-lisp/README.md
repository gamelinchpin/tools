================

My collection of Emacs customizations & enhancements.

---

 

These files comprise almost 20 years of Emacs modifications.  A lot of
them are personal customizations.  Some, however, are more
general-purpose:


* `jpw-lj-helper.el`

  A major-mode for editing LiveJournal entries.

* `phpBB-helper.el`

  A major-mode for writing messages for online forums using
  phpBB-style markup.

* `custom-defuns.el`

  My general-purpose functions.

* `jpw-indent-tools.el`

  This one is incomplete.  It contains some indentation-tools that I'm
  still working on.
