tools
=====

A collection of my more-general-purpose tools.

---

ï¿½

I have numerous scripts, in a variety of languages, that I use
day-to-day.  Many of them are for things that are specific to my Linux
boxes, or things I wrote to simplify something I do (but doubt many
other people would).  However, some may have more general appeal, and
those are the ones that I've included here.


I've organized the tools into subdirectories, by language.  Each has
its own `README.md` file, so consult it for more details about that
subdirectory.
